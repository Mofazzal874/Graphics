I am building a project with modern opengl c++.
The project is : 
- I need to implement a bus with inside and outside with different operations. 
- Implement a viewing transformation (Bird’s Eye View like camera).
- Implement Pitch (key X), Yaw (key Y) and Roll (key Z) rotations.
- Implement moving forward (key W), backward (key S), left (key A), right (key D), up (key E), and down ( key R) like a flying simulator.
- Implement rotating the camera around a look at point using key F.
- Rotating Fan (key G), Turn on/ off light (L).
- Doors and windows can be opened and closed.
- Simulate driving the bus.

These are the criteria that should be met. I need you to understand the criteria first and then first implement the first one only.I will implement the other steps of the problem one by one.  
Other criteria that you should pay attention to: 
- Do not use variables , use object instead(where's necessary). use hierarchical modeling, use cube , cylinder , torus that is first made with primitive(triangle). use parametric representation. 
- use separate file for shader and vertex for good maintainability. 
-use transformation matrix. 
- i will use visual studio 2022 to run this.
